                The Four Elms Inn is a traditional village pub situated in Four Elms Village near Edenbridge, Kent. We are close to many popular tourist attractions including Hever Castle and Chartwell. The surrounding area is also great for walking and cycling and so we are pleased to welcome many visitors each year as well as our faithful locals and regulars.
                <br/><br/>
We are housed in a wonderful old listed building with parts dating from the 16th century although it has only been a pub since the 1880s. We have a public bar with inglenook fireplace ideal for those chilly days, as well as a saloon bar and two dining areas. Outside we have a beer garden complete with petanque pitch ideal for those warmer days. We also have a good sized car park for our customers use.<br/><br/>
Because we are a privately owned freehouse we use mainly Kent and Sussex based breweries for our real ales including Nelson Brewery in Chatham, Tonbridge Brewery, Weltons of Horsham and Shepherd Neame, Britains oldest brewer.<br/><br/>
We have been here since 2016 and have no plans to move on until retirement beckons, which may be quite some time. Seriously though, stability is important and we are proud of our small but select team of professionals all of whom have been with us throughout that time We all work hard to give our customers a good experience when they visit us, we hope time and time again.<br/><br/>
We have a simple philosophy, which is to provide good non-pretentious food and drink at fair prices so that visiting the Four Elms can be almost an everyday pleasure.
